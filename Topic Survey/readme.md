# CS4518 Topic Survey - Intro to Encryption in Android Readme
## Student Information
Names: Hannah Jauris, Hung Hong
ID: hmjauris, hphong

## Overview of submission
This submission includes the following components:
- Team1050TopicSurveyStarterCode: a folder containing cleaned starter code, which people should have before starting our tutorial
- Team1050TopicSurveyCompleteCode: a folder containing cleaned complete code, which shows what the code might look like after completing our tutorial
- Team1050TopicSurvey.md, which contains the tutorial for our topic survey
- imgs: a folder containing the images linked to in the tutorial markdown file
- Team1050Demo: A video which shows our completed code working
   - Note: Since the Android studio screen recording records one screen, the demo was shown by having a device send a message to itself. This code still works for sending across different devices, although the same key must be entered into the receiving device and the sending device for the decryption to work.

## Roles in the Project
We worked together to research several methods of encryption through online documentation, and each of us implemented our own versions of message encryptor for comparison and consolidation.
- **Hung Hong** made sure the encryption could work as intended, since our first implementation faced some bad block errors that was addressed by the use of hex-to-byte conversion. He was also in charge of debugging to ensure the applicationâ€™s functionality
- **Hannah Jauris** created the base application that allowed message communication via SMS, and integrated encryption/decryption into the application. She was also in charge of putting the final product altogether so that it could be ready for demo.
Afterwards, we worked on the markdown together to make sure the tutorial is easy to understand and is effective in teaching people how to apply encryption in Android development.
